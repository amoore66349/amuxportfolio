    <h2> About Me </h2>
      <img class="picofme" src="https://assets.codepen.io/11972982/me_edited.jpg" alt="me"/>
    <p>
      I discovered UX in grad school while pursuing my Master's. After taking a class called Information Innovation and Design Thinking, I was hooked. I'm now making my way into the field as a freelancer. </p>
   <p>   I am also passionate about quality research, and am still in awe constantly of all that you can do (and discover) through user testing.

    <p> I love to chat and exchange ideas over a coffee - it's my favorite way to network. </p>
    <p>I am also a proud member of the Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF)!</p>

      Outside of work, I am probably either curled up with a good book, or yelling at the TV while the Eagles play. I also enjoy going to concerts, learning American Sign Language, cooking, and creative writing. </p>
      <p> Over the last few summers, I have finally gotten to catch up on travel. Some of my favorite moments from my trips were exploring Ostia Antica, an excavated ancient town just outside of Rome, attending a concert in Cardiff, Wales, and exploring the beautiful beaches of Cefalu, Sicily.
